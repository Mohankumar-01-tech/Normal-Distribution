# README: Normal Curves & Correlation Analysis

## Overview
This project explores **Normal Distribution** and **Correlation Analysis** using statistical methods. The `Normal_curves,_correlation.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to generate, visualize, and analyze normal curves and relationships between variables.

## Features
- Generate and visualize **normal distribution curves**.
- Calculate **mean, variance, and standard deviation**.
- Perform **correlation analysis** between datasets.
- Plot **scatter plots and regression lines**.
- Use **Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation coefficients** for analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for statistical computation.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive execution.
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data processing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization.
- **Scipy & Statsmodels** for statistical analysis.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Normal_curves,_correlation.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to generate normal distributions and analyze correlations.
3. Modify dataset values to experiment with different statistical insights.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **hypothesis testing** for correlation significance.
- Extend the project to cover **multiple regression analysis**.
- Introduce **real-world datasets** for better insights.
- Automate statistical reporting with detailed summaries.
